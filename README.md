## Overview

Gitman is a tool for working with multiple git (and specifically Github) repositories. Most people manage multiple repositories in one folder and sometimes split personal repositories and organizational repositories to separate folders.

When Gitman is run in a folder, it looks for a `.gitman-config.json` file. If the file does not exist, it asks the user to define the scope of the current folder; managing personal or organizational repositories.

Once Gitman knows the scope, it shows the list of locally cloned repositories inside the folder, and also shows a list of remotely available repositories (personal and organizational).

Updating local repositories and cloning remote repositories is  as easy as running `gitman` in the folder (or `gitman update` to directly update local repositories.)

## Usage

Run `gitman` to start managing your local and remote repositories (make sure you're in a folder that contains the repositories).
When run for the first time, Gitman will ask some configuration questions.

```sh
gitman
```

To update a list of preset local repositories, run the following (don't worry, it asks for confirmation):

```sh
gitman update
```

To forcefully update **all** local repositories:

```sh
gitman update --all
```


## Configs

Gitman optionally uses two separate config files in parallel:

* A global config file that is located in an operating system user folder.
* A local config file that is located in the folder that Gitman was ran in.

When Gitman is run for the first time ever on a computer, it asks questions to configure both the global and local config files.
When Gitman is run for the first time in a certain folder, it asks questiosns to configure the local config file for that folder.

### Global config

* **Github Token** - A user generated Github Personal Access Token.

### Local config

* **Folder Type** - Whether the current folder contains personal or organizational repositories.
* **Starred Repositories** - A list of select repositories that can be updated in batch by running `gitman update` in that folder.

### Changing configurations

Set a Github Personal Access Token (you can create one at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>):

```sh
gitman --set-token <token>
```

Clear a preset access token:

```sh
gitman --clear-token <token>
```

Select repositories to update with `gitman update`:

```sh
gitman update --select
```

Reset Gitman current folder configurations (personal or org, update selections, etc.)

```sh
gitman reset
```

Reset all of Gitman configurations (global and current folder):

```sh
gitman reset -global
```
